## Task 1

### GitHub Actions Guide

1. Firstly, I created directory `.github/workflows`
and configuration file `github-actions-demo.yml` with following content:
```yaml
name: GitHub Actions Demo
run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is testing out GitHub Actions üöÄ
on: [push]
jobs:
  Explore-GitHub-Actions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
      - run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
      - run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is ${{ github.ref }} and your repository is ${{ github.repository }}."
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: echo "üí° The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
      - run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
      - name: List files in the repository
        run: |
          ls ${{ github.workspace }}
      - run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
      - run: cat lab10.md
```
- This configuration file defines the workflow process
that will complete several task automatically. It can build and test specific pull requests, deploy the application etc.

2. I commited changes into the repository. 
In action tab commit with workflow appeard with logs of each process.

I faced with no problems during this simple guide. 


## Task 2
For the second task I need to switch to the master branch, as `workflow_dispatch` and manual run are available only on default branch.
In the main branch I created the following config file:

```yaml
name: GitHub Actions Demo
on:
  workflow_dispatch: {}
jobs:
  Gather-System-Information:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Gather Information
        run: |
          uname -a
          lscpu
          df -h
          free -m
```


- For the output I got the following content:
